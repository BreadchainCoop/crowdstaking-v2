              Breadchain is a collective federation of decentralized cooperative
              projects looking to advance a post-capitalist vision for
              blockchain and its effect on society. We aim to do this by

              1 xDAI (worth roughly $1 USD) is always equal to 1 BREAD and
              vice-versa. The BREAD token is not speculative and is always worth
              1 xDAI through this application. You can also get BREAD through
              decentralized exchanges like Curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              xDAI, which backs BREAD, is an over-collateralized stablecoin that
              comes from MakerDAO and is the native cryptocurrency of Gnosis
              Chain. Over-collateralized stablecoins offer a greater amount of
              security and less risk compared to other stablecoins.

            <p>
              That’s totally fine! Any time you like, you can burn your BREAD
              and, in doing so, receive the equivalent amount of xDAI back. To
              do so simply click on the down arrow in the middle of the
              application. All BREAD is backed 1:1 by xDAI meaning burning BREAD
              is a risk free action - there will always be xDAI available for
              you to reclaim.
