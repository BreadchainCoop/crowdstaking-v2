              $BREAD is a digital currency designed for
              solidarity. When you hold $BREAD, you&apos;re part
              of a community that decides together how to use the
              interest generated from our fund.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              1 $BREAD = 1 xDAI = $1. BREAD is not about
              speculation, but about supporting causes that matter
              to working people.

              Yes, but you don&apos;t need to have it already. Our
              bridging feature converts whichever currency you
              hold into xDAI, which you can then use to bake
              BREAD.
